# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression for detecting credit card fraud. It involves building a machine learning model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on given features.

## Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a crucial application of machine learning in the financial sector. This project utilizes a logistic regression model to predict fraudulent transactions from a dataset. The goal is to achieve high accuracy while maintaining a balance between precision and recall to effectively identify frauds without too many false positives.
